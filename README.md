Only Fortify license holders can utilize from the interface that fortify provides, namely, only Cyber Security engineers who perform the static code analysis. Software practitioners are only able to access the pdf file which is automatically prepared by Fortify after the analysis of source code. Therefore, software practitioners cannot utilize from this user interface and has to read 1000+ pages pdf file to understand the potential risks of their source code. 
Main aim of our project was to develop web application from scratch with an aim to make Fortify static code analysis results analyzable with similar user interface like Fortifyâ€™s for the  software practitioners so that they can easily interact with the results of their source codes and benefit from the advantages of it.
